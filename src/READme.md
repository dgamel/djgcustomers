#Customers 

Created a customer .csv file /Users/djg03/Documents/customers.csv
Created code to pull in the Customers list that can be displayed

When completed I was tasked with taking the POJO and converting it to JSON
   
* This required adding Jackson-mapper as a dependency
     
     
Once completed with this task I took the output string and converted it into a file in Java
    
* This required adding Java-Simple as a dependency
